	"content": "Introduction You will learn how to integrate services such as Amazon RDS, AWS Lambda, Amazon Cognito, Amazon API Gateway to build a web system or serverless application (no need to manage servers).\nAmazon RDS: You will understand how to create and manage relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) on AWS to store data.\nAWS Lambda: You will learn how to create Lambda functions to handle application logic without having to manage servers. Lambda can connect to RDS and S3 to manipulate data.\nAmazon Cognito: You will learn how to use Amazon Cognito to authenticate and manage users, secure your APIs, and authenticate requests from users.\nAPI Gateway: You will learn how to configure an API Gateway to provide HTTP endpoints that allow users or applications to communicate with Lambda, and secure the API using Cognito for authentication.\nServices covered in the workshop include: Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)\n- Amazon Relational Database Service is a managed service that allows you to deploy and manage relational databases on AWS.\r- Amazon RDS is an online transaction processing (OLTP) database.\r- The primary use case is transactional databases (rather than analytical databases).\r- It is best suited for structured and relational data storage requirements.\r- It is intended to be an easy alternative to traditional on-premises instances of the same database.\r- Automatic backups and patching are performed during customer-defined maintenance windows.\r- Scaling, replication, and availability are a click away.\rAWS Lambda\n- What it does: Lets you run code without managing servers. Lambda automatically scales to handle thousands of requests per second.\r- What it is: Run serverless functions, such as processing API requests, interacting with RDS databases, without maintaining a server.\rAmazon API Gateway\n- What it does: Provides an API to connect applications to back-end services like Lambda.\r- What it does: Create and manage RESTful or WebSocket APIs that allow users or applications to call Lambda functions over HTTP/HTTPS. API Gateway provides security, monitoring, and access control.\rAmazon Cognito\n- What it does: Provides user authentication, login management, and access rights for mobile and web applications.\r- What it does: Manage users and authenticate users in applications, protect APIs by integrating authentication with API Gateway, ensuring only logged-in users can access resources.\rAWS Service Deployment and Configuration Steps: You will practice creating AWS services and connecting them together, thereby creating a complete system. You will understand the deployment process, from creating AWS services to integrating them into a seamless operating system.\n- Create VPC and security group\r- Create and configure Amazon RDS for database.\r- Create EC2 to connect and add data to RDS instance\r- Build Lambda functions and connect to RDS.\r- Create an API Gateway and integrate with Lambda to handle requests from users.\r- Create a user pool and authenticate with Amazon Cognito.\r- Configure API Gateway security via Cognito, ensuring only authenticated users can call the API.\r"

	"content": "Overview Amazon RDS Amazon RDS is a managed database on AWS, we can only access and manage at the RDBMS level, cannot access and manage at the operating system level. Including Aurora, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, Oracle, and MariaDB. Amazon RDS provides the following features:\nAutomatic backup (both log and database - up to 35 days). Create a read-only replica (Read Replica) to serve reading workloads (reporting). Read Replica can be separated and converted into a Primary node. Run with automatic failover mechanism, Primary/Standby, also known as Multi-AZ mechanism. RDS is often used for OLTP applications. RDS provides data encryption at rest and in transit. RDS is also protected by firewall features like EC2 (Security Group and NACL). Scaling (changing instance size). Automatically increase storage capacity (Storage Auto Scale). Pricing Basically RDS charges based on parameters: Instance size. The larger the instance size, the higher the cost. Supports reserve instances similar to EC2. Amount of data stored (GB/month) Size of snapshots created. Other features such as Backtracking for Aurora. RDS Deployment Model RDS can be deployed in the following models:\nSingle Instance Single Instance with Multi-AZ option = yes Master – Read Only cluster Master – Read Only cluster with Multi-AZ option = yes Master – Multi Read cluster Single Instance Only 1 database instance is created in 1 Availability Zone (AZ). If an incident occurs at the AZ level, the database cannot be accessed. Suitable for Dev-Test environments to save costs\nSingle Instance with Multi-AZ option enabled\nA copy of the instance will be created in another AZ and operate in standby mode. The task of this standby instance is to sync data from the master, this instance cannot be accessed. When there is an incident, the standby instance will be promoted to the master (this is done automatically by AWS, the endpoint url is kept the same). If you enable multi AZ, the cost will be x2. Suitable for Database Production. Master – Read Only cluster\nAn instance with ReadOnly mode will be created and continuously replicate data from the master instance. This instance can only read data. Suitable for systems with read \u0026gt; write workloads, wanting to optimize the performance of the Database. After establishing the relationship, the created instance will be combined into 1 cluster. In the state where 2 instances have formed a cluster, if the Master instance has a problem, failover will be automatically performed, ReadOnly instance is promoted to Master. You should create a cluster and then add a read node to manage the connection at the cluster level (the number of read nodes can be optional) Note: If 2 instances are created separately and then the read-replica relationship is established, the endpoints of the 2 instances will be separate, so after failover, the connection from the App needs to be adjusted.\rMaster – Read Only cluster with Multi-AZ option = yes Similar to the Master – Read Only model, but all nodes are multi-AZ enabled. The cost will be 4 times that of the Single Instance model. Should I create an RDS Cluster or an RDS Instance? AWS provides a mechanism to create an RDS cluster to make node management and failover easier.\nAdvantages compared to creating a normal RDS instance:\nEndpoint management at the cluster level, not changed when an instance in the cluster has a problem. Automatic failover. Easy to scale read instances. Contents Create DB Subnet Group Create RDS Instance Launch EC2 Instance Create lambda function Connect RDS with lambda "
